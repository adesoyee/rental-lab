## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze and model rental pricing data, which aims to derive insights that can inform more equitable and accessible housing solutions. By examining factors that influence rental prices, such as location, amenities, and property characteristics, this project seeks to provide valuable information for renters, property owners, and policymakers.

## Project Description
To work on this project we had to interprete data and expand on it. The project primarily relies on a dataset containing rental pricing data, property details, and location information. My team was tasked with analyzing and predicting the dataset our client collected to determine how much they should charge for their properties. We created hsitograms to help visualize, cleaned up tables and removed outliers. A challenge was that I delved right into this with no prior knowlegde of what I am doing. I am still so glad I did it. A civil impact though is contributing to the broader discourse on equitable housing solutions.
